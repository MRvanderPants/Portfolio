      <p class="description">
        Perilous Parking is a short, re-playable arcade game made in Unity that lets you drive around town as a parking spot, causing havoc where you go. The game offers a mix of different missions that need to be completed before the timer runs out to earn a spot in the high-scores.

      <p class="description">
        This currently in development framework uses facial recognition to track a players face and expression, so that it can be used as an input device for games. The players head can be used as a collision box, and expressions can be used to input gameplay commands.
